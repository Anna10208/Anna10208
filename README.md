## Hi there 👋
I'm Hanna - a data analyst with over 10 years of experience in business process optimization across manufacturing, healthcare, and wholesale industries. I also have strong expertise in budgeting and reporting. Recently, I’ve focused on data-driven tools, building skills in Python, Excel, and Power BI.

I’m passionate about clean structures, clear visuals, and solutions that save both time and sanity. Combining analytical thinking with business logic, I help teams make decisions based on data, not assumptions.

🤝 I’m open to collaboration on practical data analysis projects or contributing to tools that enhance workflows.
